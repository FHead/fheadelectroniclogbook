\DailySection{DQM code!}

An analyzer (\texttt{HcalMonitorModule}) keeps filling histograms and keeping them in memory.
The histograms (embedded in \texttt{MonitorElement}) are ``booked'' through \texttt{DQMStore} service and the ownership of the histogram memory is the service....whatever it is.
There are a list of ``clients'' that correspond to subfolders....and same story with the \texttt{DQMStore} and histogram booking.
The entrance module for the clients is \texttt{HcalMonitorClient}.  To make sure that I know what's going on,
let me introduce a new subfolder called ``HcalFHeadMonitor'' where I can put my own histograms.
Good.  Successfully installed the new subfolder.  See figure \ref{6314_InstalledFHeadMonitorScreenShot}.
Try to add a histogram.  It showed up wouldn't fill at all.  Let's play with it tomorrow.
