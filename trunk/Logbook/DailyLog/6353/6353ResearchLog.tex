\begin{enumerate}
\item Finish infrastructure for making cut positions.
\item Run on more data!
\end{enumerate}

\DailySection{Summary List}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Setup script to find cut position
\end{enumerate}

\DailySection{Setting cut positions}

Side note: should I make a different limit for HB and HE?  Maybe later when I have more statistics.

A reduced tree is produced with total charge and various discriminants, after cleaning.
Only events with nominal MET smaller than 200 is kept for a better signal purity.
This tree is then fed into another program that calculates cut positions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item First sort all records in total charge
\item Group every 500000 (this count changeable) pulses into a group
\item For each group sort in terms of discriminants and decide cut position from tolerance level (roughly 0.01\%)
\end{enumerate}

The chain is working.  I still need to find a way to smooth it out.
