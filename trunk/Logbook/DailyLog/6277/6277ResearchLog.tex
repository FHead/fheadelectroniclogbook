\end{enumerate}

\DailySection{Vecbos ntuple dumper job submission}

From the checkout in \texttt{CMSSW\_3\_8\_2}, the template did not work out of the box.  I had to add in btagging-related configuration files and sequences

\begin{verbatim}
process.load("HiggsAnalysis.HiggsToWW2e.btagProducerSequence_cff")
process.load("HiggsAnalysis.HiggsToWW2e.btagPFJetsProducerSequence_cff")
process.load("HiggsAnalysis.HiggsToWW2e.btagJPTJetsProducerSequence_cff")
...
   process.newBtaggingSequence *
   process.newPFJetBtaggingSequence *
   process.newJPTJetBtaggingSequence *
...
\end{verbatim}

to make it work.  Also I have to go into \texttt{HiggsAnalysis.HiggsToWW2e.jetProducerSequence\_cff} and remove the line
which includes \texttt{JetMETCorrections.Configuration.JetCorrectionCondDB\_cff}.  There is also
a problem on castor.  One needs to change permission to 775 to be able to stage out to the directory:

\begin{verbatim}
rfchmod 775 /castor/cern.ch/user/....
\end{verbatim}

Now it seems to be working.....Hopefully nothing else go wrong.

\DailySection{Reflection}

Playing with crab/castor is really a waste of time.....

\DailySection{Goals for next work day}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Submit vecbos ntuple jobs
\item Make a to-write list for Z candle
\item Do one round of subtraction and look at remaining noise
\item Try out Hcal DQM GUI on lxplus
\end{enumerate}
