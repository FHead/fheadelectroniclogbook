\DailySection{Goals}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Finalize flagger code
\item Have fun with Hcal noise fitting
\item Side project: prepare code structure for particle gun studies
\end{enumerate}

\DailySection{Summary List}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Implemented fit flagger into CMSSW reco structure
\end{enumerate}

\DailySection{Flagger implementation}

Added class \texttt{HBHEPulseShapeFlagSetter} in package \texttt{RecoLocalCalo/HcalRecProducers}, files \texttt{HBHEPulseShapeFlag.cc} (and \texttt{.h}), in \texttt{CMSSW} version \texttt{3\_9\_1}.
Pulse shape is directly from \texttt{HcalPulseShape} class, without extra input text file.
Things compile.  Now I should add the flag fields in the double-chi2 tree, and check performance.
Now that the reconstruction is in \texttt{CMSSW\_3\_9\_1}, reflagger for JP filter is probably not necessary, and the bit position is also different.
Let's write out the full aux word for now.

ps. it should be the \texttt{flag} word
