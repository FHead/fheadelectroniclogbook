\DailySection{MC pulse shape behavior}

The \texttt{RelValTTbar} sample finishes very fast (within a couple hours).  There are 9000 events in them.
Everything (above 20 fC) passed the linear discriminator if we cut at -0.5.  For the RMS8/Max, if we cut at -11,
there is a pulse (roughly 5 GeV) that will fail.  I decided that I won't care about it now.
If the threshold is lowered to 10 fC, 11 pulses fail the linear discriminator, all below 2 GeV.
For RMS8/Max, still, only one pulse fails.
