\DailySection{Note on WJet dataset code debugging}

I keep getting ``glibc: memory corruption'' errors.  It happens when my \texttt{MuonCandidate} has all the fields in.
If I remove any of them, then the code runs fine.  I ended up removing the combined isolation since people won't be using it.

\DailySection{Reflection}

Debugging has taken a lot of time.  Maybe I haven't written program for too long.  As a result it was not a productive day.
