\DailySection{Goals}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Test out the two round-3 candidate ideas
\item Code timing performance
\item Add reference to the hcal note
\end{enumerate}

\DailySection{Timing performance}

Did a test run on \texttt{Jet} dataset, run 149011, file \texttt{66A2FF37-3EE1-DF11-9934-0030487C8CBE.root} from \texttt{CASTOR} area.
10000 events run.  The result is shown in figure \ref{Figure_6363_JetDataset10000EventExecutionTime}.
Average execution time (CPU) for one event is roughly 1 ms.  Module \texttt{hbheprereco} is the standard Hcal reconstruction with fitting flags turned on.
Module \texttt{hbheprereconofitting} is the same thing except with fitting flags turned off.
Module \texttt{hbhereco} is the isolation-based flagging from JP.

\DailySection{Action items for Hcal noise}

Talked briefly with Artur.  Needed to do

\begin{enumerate}
\item Smooth cut position curves.
\item Get timing envelope from Phil and test it.
\item MC?
\item Cleaned number of events?
\end{enumerate}


\DailySection{Preliminary plots for cleaning efficiency}

Take good noise events from the \texttt{HcalHPDNoise} sample, and plot the rechit energy distribution after each step of cleaning.
The distributions are shown in figure \ref{Figure_6363_RecHitEnergyDistributionCleaning}.
Rate of rechits remaining after cut is shown in figure \ref{Figure_6363_RecHitEnergyDistributionCleaningRatio}.
