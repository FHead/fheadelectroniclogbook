\DailySection{50ns brainstorm session}

What are we going to do for 50 ns bunch spacing?

\begin{enumerate}
\item Collision identification.  We need to know if there are any collisions in TS 0, 2, 6, 8.
If no collision, safe to proceed with simple scenario.
In sub-percent level, there will be overlap.  What to do then?
\end{enumerate}
