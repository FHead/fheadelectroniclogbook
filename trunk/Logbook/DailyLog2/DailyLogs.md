### Plot making ###

* Redo fit result plots with legend and with CMS prelimiary
    * WJet fit
    * Top fit
    * QCD fit
    * Electron overlay plots
    * Hadronic overlay plots
* Plot that shows improvement when we select higher threshold for b-jet counting
* We need new spaghetti plots
* Legend on the trigger plots larger
* Higher statistics for the example 2D plot
* Check with Alex to see if he has updated trigger plots (?)

### Note ###

* Checking through one round of the note and do updates
    * Chapter 1
    * Chapter 2
    * Chapter 3
    * Chapter 5
    * Chapter 6
    * Chapter 7
* Update the yield table to new statistics

### Fitting ###

* Start redoing the fits for JES up and down
* Leave the normalization ones for later
* Swap Wjet and ttjet

### Code reading ###

* Re-read and make sure of the algorithm to generate limits - expected limits for now
